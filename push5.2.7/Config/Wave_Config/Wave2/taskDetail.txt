All optimical way as follow:
1.totalProfit
2.Sharp
3.WinRet
4.AverageProfit/AverageLoss
5.Using first X percentage of profit indicators to get a intersection A,then use the same method on risk indicators to get a intersection B,finally get the best one by sharp
6.Using first X percentage of all indicators to get a intersection A,get the best one by the best sharp
Please choose a way to optimize:
